      <a href="https://github.com/Kevin-Nduati/Sarcasm-Detection">
        Sarcasm Detection -
      </a>
      The project aimed to detect sarcasm in text using natural language processing techniques. Two models were used: a word2vec model and a BERT model, both implemented using Hugging Face. The performance of both models was compared to determine which one was better at detecting sarcasm. The project aimed to contribute to the field of sentiment analysis by improving the accuracy of sarcasm detection.

        Data Engineering on Immigration Data -
      </a>
      The project aimed to detect sarcasm in text using natural language processing techniques. Two models were used: a word2vec model and a BERT model, both implemented using Hugging Face. The performance of both models was compared to determine which one was better at detecting sarcasm. The project aimed to contribute to the field of sentiment analysis by improving the accuracy of sarcasm detection.The project aimed to study immigration data in the United States with regards to world temperature data, U.S. city demographic data, and airport code data. The goal was to extract each dataset from its source and apply several levels of transformation before loading it into an analytics database using ETL pipelines. The new consolidated data model would serve the analysis and study needs of the project. Airflow was used as the workflow management tool, and Spark was employed for data analysis. The project aimed to provide insights into the relationship between immigration, weather, demographics, and airport locations in the United States.

      <a href="https://github.com/Kevin-Nduati/My-Spotify-Wrapped">
        Spotify Wrapped -
      </a>
      The project aimed to create a personalized version of Spotify Wrapped, which summarizes a user's listening history for the year. The project used airflow for orchestration, Docker for containerization, dbt for modeling and transforming data, and GitHub Actions for continuous integration and delivery. The goal was to extract the user's listening history data from Spotify's API, transform it, and load it into a database. The transformed data would then be used to generate personalized insights and visualizations summarizing the user's listening history. The project aimed to provide a fun and engaging way for users to reflect on their musical tastes and preferences over time.

      <a href="https://github.com/Kevin-Nduati/Market-Analysis-using-Clustering">Market Analysis using Clustering - </a>
      The project aimed to cluster customers in a mall based on their features such as age, gender, income, and shopping behavior. The k-means clustering algorithm was used to group customers with similar features into distinct clusters. The results were used to gain insights into the shopping behavior of different customer segments, such as young professionals or families with children, to assist mall management in optimizing their marketing and sales strategies for each group. Ultimately, the project aimed to improve the mall's profitability and customer satisfaction by providing personalized shopping experiences for each customer segment.

    <a href="https://github.com/Kevin-Nduati/Bank-Customer-Churn-Modelling">Bank Customer 
    Churn Analysis - </a>
    The project focused on churn prediction in a business using machine learning techniques to deal with an imbalanced dataset. The aim was to predict which customers were likely to churn, i.e., leave the business, by using different techniques to deal with the imbalance in the dataset. These techniques included random oversampling, random undersampling, SMOTE, SMOTE Nearmiss, and SMOTE Tomek Links. The performance of each technique was compared, and the best one was selected. A machine learning model was then trained using the selected technique to predict churn, and its performance was evaluated. The project aimed to assist the business in identifying customers who were likely to churn and taking proactive measures to retain them.
